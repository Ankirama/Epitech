Build / Execute EpiAndroid
--------------------------

We used Android Studio to create this project, so you have some options to execute our application.
You will be able to execute this application in differents ways:

* :ref:`exec-ide`
* :ref:`exec-apk`

.. _exec-ide:

Use an IDE to run the solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use an IDE to run the solution. We created this project with Intellij, but you can use another IDE.

If you will use another IDE, we cannot guarantee the result.

.. _exec-apk:

Download the application on play store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We added our application on the play store, so you can download it without any restriction! That's amazing!

This project is the last from the java module and it allows us to undestand how to create an android application.

The goal was to implement some features like intra.epitech.eu.

To create this project we used SDK 15 (Android 4.0.3)
