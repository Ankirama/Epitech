Getting Started
===============

This document will contain information about how to use our JWeb.
This docs is written in `reStructuredText <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_

Build / Execute JWeb
--------------------

To use JWeb you will need to install `Tomcat 8.X <https://tomcat.apache.org>`_.
You will have some options to execute JWeb.

* :ref:`exec-jar`
* :ref:`exec-exe`
* :ref:`exec-ide`

.. _exec-jar:

Execute jar file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The jar file is not yet implemented, there was a problem to build it with Intellij on Mac OSX Yosemite.

.. _exec-exe:

Execute exe file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

you can run an .exe.
Unfortunately we created the project on mac, so this solution is unaivable.

.. _exec-ide:

Use an IDE to run the solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use an IDE to run the solution. We created this project with Intellij on Mac, but you can use another IDE.

If you will use another IDE, we cannot guarantee the result.

About the project itself
------------------------

This project is the second from the Java module and it allows us to undestand how to deploy a website with Java (Servlet etc...).

The goal was to create a e-commerce website and implement some features like an admin panel, add news etc etc...
