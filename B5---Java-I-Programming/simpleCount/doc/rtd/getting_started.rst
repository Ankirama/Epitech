Getting Started
===============

This document will contain informations about how to exectude our application simpleCount.
This docs is written in `reStructuredText <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_

Build / Execute simpleCount
---------------------------

To use it you have some options:

* :ref:`exec-jar`
* :ref:`exec-exe`
* :ref:`exec-ide`

.. _exec-jar:

Execute jar file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The jar file is not yet implemented, there was a problem to build it with Intellij on Mac OSX Yosemite.

.. _exec-exe:

Execute exe file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

you can run an .exe.
Unfortunately we created the project on mac, so this solution is unaivable.

.. _exec-ide:

Use an IDE to run the solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use an IDE to run the solution. We created this project with Intellij on Mac, but you can use another IDE.

If you will use another IDE, we cannot guarantee the result.

About the project itself
------------------------

This project is the first from the Java module and we used it to learn how to work with this language.

We had to create a simpleCalculator like a windows calcultor or the google calculator.
